# ETL-Project-Proposal 

We are collecting data to webscrape from music platforms such as BillBoards, and Spotify. 
For the purpose of this project we will be scraping the top 100 artist 2020 across different music platforms. 

Octavia will be calling in the API's from Spotify. Amanda will do the webscraping. Sadia will do the cleaning of the data.
