# ETL-Project-Proposal 

We are collecting data to webscrape from music platforms such as BillBoards, Apple and Spotify. 
For the purpose of this project we will be scraping the top 5 artist 2020. 

Octavia will be calling in the API's. Amanda will do the webscraping. Sadia will do the cleaning of the data.
